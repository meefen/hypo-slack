<h1 data-label="405271" class="ltx_title_section">Literature review</h1><h2 data-label="923564" class="ltx_title_subsection">Online discourse in education </h2><div>Discourse—defined as language-based interaction between two or more people—plays a fundamental role in learning and cognition&nbsp; (Gee, 1989; Resnick, Säljö, Pontecorvo, &amp; Burge, 1997; Vygotsky, 1962) . From a group of middle-schoolers talking through a math problem to online debates on economic globalization, discourse provides opportunities for people to make their thinking visible&nbsp; (Erduran, Simon, &amp; Osborne, 2004) , become exposed to new perspectives&nbsp; (Nussbaum, 2008) , and expand their ideas when trying to accommodate differences&nbsp; (Weinberger &amp; Fischer, 2006) . Online discourse—discourse that is mediated by Web technologies—has been widely used to support learning in both formal and informal settings and across grade levels. The educational use of online discourse can, in its best form, engender positive learning experiences by enabling active, interactive, constructive exchanges among learners&nbsp; (Chi &amp; Menekse, 2015) . With support from computer tools that expand the limits of the human mind&nbsp; (Jonassen, Carr, &amp; Yueh, 1998) , online discourse could play a range of roles including transmitting ideas, coordinating cognitive actions in groups, and mediating self-organized collaboration in large-scale networks&nbsp; (Chen, Clarke, &amp; Resnick, 2015; Resnick et al., 1997; Szell, Lambiotte, &amp; Thurner, 2010; Wertsch, 1993) . Despite the popularity of online discourse, its main supporting tool—text-based discussion forums—have remained largely unchanged over the past two decades. Noticeable changes have been mostly technical, such as updating software architecture, incorporating emojis, and allowing users to mention each other. The threaded format of discussion forums has remained intact. In the meantime, educational researchers and practitioners have documented&nbsp; a range of problems&nbsp; with online discourse—including premature topic abandonment&nbsp; (Hewitt, 2005) , unresolved confusion&nbsp; (Kim &amp; Kang, 2014) , incoherent discussion flow&nbsp; (Thomas, 2002) , and inflexibility with connecting ideas across spaces&nbsp; (Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 2014) . Novel solutions are needed to tackle these challenges in the educational use of online discourse. 2.2. Web annotations Web annotations provide a fertile ground for addressing the gap highlighted above. Annotation, be it online or paper-based, is an important part of human cognition. Making annotations is a highly developed activity, one that represents an important part of reading, writing, and scholarship&nbsp; (Marshall, 1997) . While annotations are generally considered marginal, peripheral, and secondary, in-depth analysis of&nbsp; &nbsp; annotations in used books has revealed their added value to the “primary” content and their influence on later book readers&nbsp; (Liu, 2005) . Annotations blur the roles of reader and writer, and manifest as a&nbsp; socio-technical system wherein impactful interactions take place (Marshall, 1997). Since the World Wide Web hosts an ocean of digital documents nowadays, annotations of Web content is becoming prevalent. Similar to annotations in paper-based books, Web annotations are extra pieces of information associated with existing, primary Web resources such as news articles, blogs, or online textbooks&nbsp; (Haslhofer, Simon, Sanderson, &amp; Sompel, 2011) . With recent innovations in design and technical implementation, Web annotation is posited to create a new layer of interactivity on top of the Web&nbsp; (W3C Web Annotation Working Group, 2016) . In contrast with traditional threaded-discussion tools, Web annotations are more contextualized within discussed content,&nbsp; distributed across spaces, and&nbsp; linkable among systems, and thus offer richer opportunities for participatory engagement in online spaces&nbsp; (Jenkins, 2006) . So far Web annotations have been used by educators to support individual consumption of textbook knowledge&nbsp; (Ovsiannikov, Arbib, &amp; McNeill, 1999) and to facilitate knowledge sharing among students&nbsp; (Chen, Hwang, &amp; Wang, 2012; Kennedy, 2016) . Early evidence has demonstrated the potential of Web annotations in enabling richer communication than threaded-discussion tools do&nbsp; (Su, Yang, Hwang, &amp; Zhang, 2010) . However,&nbsp; two significant gaps&nbsp; manifest in current educational use of Web annotations. The first gap exists in empirical research. Empirical studies of educational use of Web annotation systems emphasize usability and usefulness&nbsp; (Azouaou, Chen, &amp; Desmoulins, 2004) , with at best summative learning outcomes explored&nbsp; (Hwang, Wang, &amp; Sharples, 2007; Li, Pow, &amp; Cheung, 2015) . Investigation of the nuanced group knowledge processes supported by Web annotations remains scarce.&nbsp; The second gap is in pedagogical designs surrounding Web annotations. Web annotations are predominantly used for&nbsp; knowledge consumption and&nbsp; sharing, but not for&nbsp; knowledge creation—a newer conception of learning&nbsp; (Paavola &amp; Hakkarainen, 2005; van Aalst, 2009) . No efforts have been committed to turning Web annotations into “collective intelligence” for knowledge-generating practices that are increasingly emphasized by curriculum standards (e.g., NGSS Lead States, 2013). Strong pedagogical designs are required to unleash the full potential of Web annotations for 21st century learning.</div><div>Research Questions</div><div>Overarching question: What is the nature of social learning supported by web annotation and team collaboration tools (Hypothesis and Slack)?</div><div>- How do students engage with Hypothesis?
